# Vizify - Simple service to render Graphviz input as an SVG

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ello/vizify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ello/vizify)

We occasionally have a need to put things like graphs and diagrams in project
READMEs. [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) is an awesome tool for that sort
of thing, but it's always been a bit of a pain to actually get rendered graphs
processed and linked in.

This service lets you generate an SVG from a Graphviz source, passed either via
a URL or as a string, e.g.

`http://<your-service-hostname>/?url=<something>`

or

`http://<your-service-hostname>/?dot=<contents of a DOT file>`


### Quickstart

This is a vanilla Ruby/Sinatra application:

* Install rbenv/rvm/Ruby 2.3
* Clone this repo
* Run `bundle install`
* Run the test suite with `bundle exec rake`

##### Deployment, Operations, and Gotchas
The service is packaged up with an Aptfile for [the APT buildpack](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-apt) that should allow it to be pushed directly to a Heroku application.

After cloning this repo and creating your Heroku app, you'll need to add the APT buildpack to your configuration using the following:

```
$ heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-apt.git
```
